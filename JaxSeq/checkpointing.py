""" 
Custom msgpack checkpointer that saves large train states by serializing
    and saving tensors one by one in a streaming fashion. Avoids running
    out of memory or local TPU disk with default flax checkpointer. The
        checkpointer saves the train state in an asynchronous manner to avoid
    timing out on JAX barriers in multi-host training.
